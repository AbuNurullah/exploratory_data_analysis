For the project1 under the "exploratory data analysis" course, a number of scripts are
provided.

1) the script labelled "loadplotdata.R" reads the zipped data from the location
indicated in the assignent page, unzips it, read the data, casts date and time
fields of the original data with two functions - strptime(), as.Date() respectively

2) After proper data casting, the original data is subsetted as a data frame, df_sub
which becomes the input for subsequent plotting calls.

3) there are four plotting scripts labelled plot1.R, plot2.R, Plot3.R, Plot4.R  respectively
Each of these scripts will generate a plot as has been asked in the assignment.
